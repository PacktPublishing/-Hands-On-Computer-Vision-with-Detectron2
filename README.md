This is the code repository for [Hands On Computer Vision with Detectron2](https://www.packtpub.com/product/object-detection-and-segmentation-using-detectron2/9781800561625), published by Packt.

**Develop object detection and segmentation models with a code and visualization approach**

## What is this book about?

Computer vision is a crucial component of many modern businesses, including automobiles, robotics, and manufacturing, and its market is growing rapidly. This book helps you explore Detectron2, Facebook's next-gen library providing cutting-edge detection and segmentation algorithms. It’s used in research and practical projects at Facebook to support computer vision tasks, and its models can be exported to TorchScript or ONNX for deployment.

The book provides you with step-by-step guidance on using existing models in Detectron2 for computer vision tasks (object detection, instance segmentation, key-point detection, semantic detection, and panoptic segmentation). You’ll get to grips with the theories and visualizations of Detectron2’s architecture and learn how each module in Detectron2 works. As you advance, you’ll build your practical skills by working on two real-life projects (preparing data, training models, fine-tuning models, and deployments) for object detection and instance segmentation tasks using Detectron2. Finally, you’ll deploy Detectron2 models into production and develop Detectron2 applications for mobile devices.

By the end of this deep learning book, you’ll have gained sound theoretical knowledge and useful hands-on skills to help you solve advanced computer vision tasks using Detectron2.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Build computer vision applications using existing models in Detectron2
* Grasp the concepts underlying Detectron2’s architecture and components
* Develop real-life projects for object detection and object segmentation using Detectron2
* Improve model accuracy using Detectron2’s performance-tuning techniques
* Deploy Detectron2 models into server environments with ease
* Develop and deploy Detectron2 models into browser and mobile environments

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
import os
data_folder = "braintumors"
data_folder_yolo = data_folder + "_yolo"
data_folder_coco = data_folder + "_coco"
folders = os.listdir("braintumors")
print(folders)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

If you are a deep learning application developer, researcher, or software developer with some prior knowledge about deep learning, this book is for you to get started and develop deep learning models for computer vision applications. Even if you are an expert in computer vision and curious about the features of Detectron2, or you would like to learn some cutting-edge deep learning design patterns, you will find this book helpful. Some HTML, Android, and C++ programming skills are advantageous if you want to deploy computer vision applications using these platforms.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-13).
